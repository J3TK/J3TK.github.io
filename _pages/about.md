Hi! I’m Jet Kok, a Networking and Cybersecurity student at Virginia Tech, passionate about embedded systems, cybersecurity, and computer engineering. With hands-on experience in software development, hardware debugging, and microcontroller programming, I thrive in solving complex technical challenges and designing innovative solutions.

I’ve had the privilege of interning at Cubic Corporation as an Embedded Engineering Intern, where I worked on an in-house UPS board, programming NXP microprocessors, debugging hardware/software issues, and implementing key communication protocols like ADC, SPI, and I2C. In addition, my upcoming Cybersecurity Associate Internship at General Dynamics Information Technology will allow me to further explore my interests in securing digital systems and networks.

Beyond my academic and professional experience, I’m an entrepreneur at heart. I founded Jet-Tek PCs, a business dedicated to building, refurbishing, and selling custom computers. Over the years, I grew the business to over $90,000 in revenue, providing tech support, consulting, and premium PC builds with stellar customer satisfaction.

My passion for technology extends to personal projects, from developing an embedded home audio system with an OLED spectrogram display to creating games on Texas Instruments microcontroller boards. Whether coding in C++ and C, working with FPGAs, or troubleshooting circuits in LTSpice, I’m always eager to expand my knowledge and push the boundaries of innovation.

Outside of tech, I’m involved in the Chinese American Society at Virginia Tech, where I contribute to event planning, videography, and community outreach.

Feel free to explore my projects and connect with me on LinkedIn!
